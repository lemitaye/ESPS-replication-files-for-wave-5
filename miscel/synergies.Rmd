## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
cell_ht_all <- read_csv("cell_ht_all.csv")
cell_ht_pnl <- read_csv("cell_ht_pnl.csv")
```

```{r}

col_n <- length(cell_ht_all$label)

x <- rep(2, col_n)

names(x) <- cell_ht_all$label

col_hd <- rep(c("Wave 4", "Wave 5"), col_n)

```

### Summary matrix of joint adoption rates, 2018/19 vs. 2021/22 --- All households
```{r}

cell_ht_all  %>% 
  kable(
    escape = F, align = "c", col.names = c("", col_hd),
    caption = "Summary matrix of joint adoption rates, 2018/19 vs. 2021/22 --- All households"
    ) %>%
  add_header_above(c("", x)) %>%
  column_spec(seq(1, col_n, by = 2), border_right = T) %>% 
  column_spec(2:col_n, width_min = "2cm") %>% 
  column_spec(1, width_min = "4cm") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) 

```

```{r}
